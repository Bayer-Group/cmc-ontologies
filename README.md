# cmc-ontologies
CMC Ontologies contains all the ontologies/models required in CMC. It has separate folders for different scopes like Solubility scope, Stability Scope etc. All the files are turtle files (.ttl). The Stability Scope folder also contains some generally used ontologies like cmc_coredev.ttl and cmc_pharmdev.ttl which has common properties/classes used in CMC. (TBC)
